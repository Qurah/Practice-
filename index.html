            How do travel agencies get paid? will I be charged extra or will my accommodations have an extra fee?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We are paid by the resorts, we do not charge a service fee.</p>
        
       <p> Many resorts have price parity, the cost is same whether you book through us, direct with the resort, or with an online booking engine.  </p>
        
    <p>The difference between using a travel agent is that we help you plan a stress-free vacation without the hassle of going it alone.

                Why should I book with you instead of an online booking site, or direct with a resort?
            </h3>
            <p>
                With us, you get exceptional personal assistance before, during, and after your vacation. </p>
        
                <p> Budget is important and we strive to get your dream vacation within the budget you've set for it. There's no pressure to go above and beyond what you're comfortable with. You can't enjoy your vacation when you're stressed out about paying for it. </p> 
        
                    <p> We provide honest advice about all resorts and destinations to help you choose the perfect resort for you.  </p>
        
                        <p> You also benefit from our extensive personal connections which carry a certain gravitas when needing anything addressed. We have an easier time getting you perks (like getting your room upgraded)â€”it's easier for us to get a "yes" because we work with them often. </p>
        
                            <p> We also arm you with your own personal <span style="color: #EBC154;">+23408</span> call number to call and reach us if you need something while you're away. You won't get that from a travel site.  </p>

            <h3>Will I pay more for vacation if I book through you than an online booking site?</h3>
            <p>
                No. We have access to all the same pricing for resorts as the online booking sites do and we can price-match online booking engine pricing when comparing apples to apples.</p> 
        
       <p> In many cases, we can find discounts and other promotional offerings that are not offered to the general public.
